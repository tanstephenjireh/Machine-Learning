( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under \\' protest \\' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol .  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh \" , a senior mseb official said .  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members \" , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational \\' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . \\x01 & the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , \\x01 8 a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board \\x01 , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc \\' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders \\' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board \\' s  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board \\' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government \\' s guarantee and then the union government \\' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government \\' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty .  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb \\' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc \\x01 , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india \\x01 , s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday \\x01 , s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc \\x01 , s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security \\x01 * other than assets \\x01 * like a sovereign cover . \\x01 & it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , \\x01 8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi \\x01 * with mseb parroting the same \\x01 * were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets \\x01 * even those under phase - i \\x01 * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india \\x01 , s managing director k wade cline to serve a \\x01 + \\x01 + preliminary \\x01 , \\x01 , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a \\x01 + \\x01 + procedural \\x01 , \\x01 , move consistent with dpc \\x01 , s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . \\x01 + \\x01 + our ( centre \\x01 , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year \\x01 , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , \\x01 , \\x01 , power secretary a k basu said . \\x01 + \\x01 + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year \\x01 , s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc \\x01 , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , \\x01 , \\x01 , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc \\x01 , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar \\x01 * both directors on the dpc board \\x01 * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly \\x01 + \\x01 + threatening \\x01 , \\x01 , to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra \\x01 * a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc \\x01 , s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation \\' too late \\' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project \\' \\' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved \\' \\' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late \\' \\' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step \\' \\' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre \\' s liability in case of termination is one year \\' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders \\' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , \\' \\' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable ,  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , \\' \\' said a top banker who was present during the lenders \\' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , \\' \\' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , \\' \\' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu \\' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india \\' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time \\' \\' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party \\' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , \\' \\' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period \\' \\' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . \\' \\' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time \\' to serve the notice , \\' \\' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest \\' \\' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , \\' \\' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra \\' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors \\' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of  party \" . when contacted , the company \\' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  our views after a few days ,  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board \\' s decision as  decision \" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board \\' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc \\' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government ,  dpc \\' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government \\' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron \\' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company \\x01 , s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre \\x01 , s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year \\x01 , s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . \\x01 & we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , \\x01 8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore \\x01 + protest payment \\x01 , by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron \\x01 , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . \\x01 & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , \\x01 8 a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre \\x01 , s and state \\x01 , s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron \\x01 , s decision unfortunate . \\x01 & we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . \\x01 8 the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol \\x01 , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years \\x01 , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc \\x01 , s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron \\x01 , s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron \\x01 , s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi . \\x01 & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , \\x01 8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc \\x01 , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs \\x01 & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . \\x01 & in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . \\x01 8 mid day \\' dpc may not wind up \\' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc \\' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state \\' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said ,  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice .  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added ,  take any harsh decision .  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . \" enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said ,  to give any comment . \" mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers \\' no comment \\' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments \\' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were \\' confidential \\' .  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make ,  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company \\' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . \" mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don \\' t want to take any hasty decision ,  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state \\x0f 9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 \\' enron \\' s on ! \\' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation \\' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted .  waiting for their letter ,  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said ,  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron \\' s decision but as of now the project is still on .  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron \\' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides ,  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .'"

up call by joe berardino  the wall street journal al 8 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones in particular , our role as auditors of year - end financial statements presented by management . we invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year to improve our audit capabilities , train our people and enhance quality . when a client fails , we study what happened , from top to bottom , to learn important lessons and do better . we are doing that with enron . we are cooperating fully with investigations into enron . if we have made mistakes , we will acknowledge them . if we need to make changes , we will . we are very clear about our responsibilities . what we do is important . so is getting it right . enron has admitted that it made some bad investments , was over - leveraged , and authorized dealings that undermined the confidence of investors , credit - rating agencies , and trading counter - parties . enron ' s trading business and its revenue streams collapsed , leading to bankruptcy . if lessons are to be learned from enron , a range of broader issues need to be addressed . among them : - - rethinking some of our accounting standards . like the tax code , our accounting rules and literature have grown in volume and complexity as we have attempted to turn an art into a science . in the process , we have fostered a technical , legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with the form rather than the substance of what is reported . enron provides a good example of how such orthodoxy can make it harder for investors to appreciate what ' s going on in a business . like many companies today , enron used sophisticated financing vehicles known as special purpose entities ( spes ) and other off - balance - sheet structures . such vehicles permit companies , like enron , to increase leverage without having to report debt on their balance sheet . wall street has helped companies raise billions with these structured financings , which are well known to analysts and investors . as the rules stand today , sponsoring companies can keep the assets and liabilities of spes off their consolidated financial statements , even though they retain a majority of the related risks and rewards . basing the accounting rules on a risk / reward concept would give investors more information about the consolidated entity ' s financial position by having more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet ; certainly more information than disclosure alone could ever provide . the profession has been debating how to account for spes for many years . it ' s time to rethink the rules . - - modernizing our broken financial - reporting model . enron ' s collapse , like the dot - com meltdown , is a reminder that our financial - reporting model - - with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings - per - share number - - is out of date and unresponsive to today ' s new business models , complex financial structures , and associated business risks . enron disclosed reams of information , including an eight - page management ' s discussion & analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report . some analysts studied these , sold short and made profits . but other sophisticated analysts and fund managers have said that , although they were confused , they bought and lost money . we need to fix this problem . we can ' t long maintain trust in our capital markets with a financial - reporting system that delivers volumes of complex information about what happened in the past , but leaves some investors with limited understanding of what ' s happening at the present and what is likely to occur in the future . the current financial - reporting system was created in the 1930 s for the industrial age . that was a time when assets were tangible and investors were sophisticated and few . there were no derivatives . no structured off - balance - sheet financings . no instant stock quotes or mutual funds . no first call estimates . and no lou dobbs or cnbc . we need to move quickly but carefully to a more dynamic and richer reporting model . disclosurs needs to be continuous , not periodic , to reflect today ' s 24 / 7 capital markets . we need to provide several streams of relevant information . we need to expand the number of key performance indicators , beyond earnings per share , to present the information investors really need to understand a company ' s business model and its business risks , financial structure and operating performance . - - reforming our patchwork regulatory environment . an alphabet soup of institutions - - from the aicpa ( american institute of certified public accountants ) to the sec and the asb ( auditing standards board ) , eitf ( emerging issues task force ) and fasb ( financial accounting standards board ) to the pob ( public oversight board ) - - all have important roles in our profession ' s regulatory framework . they are all made up of smart , diligent , well - intentioned people . but the system is not keeping up with the issues raised by today ' s complex financial issues . standard - setting is too slow . responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession . all of us must focus on ways to improve the system . agencies need more resources and experts . processes need to be redesigned . the accounting profession needs to acknowledge concerns about our system of discipline and peer review , and address them . some criticisms are off the mark , but some are well deserved . for our part , we intend to work constructively with the sec , congress , the accounting profession and others to make the changes needed to put these concerns to rest . - - improving accountability across our capital system . unfortunately , we have witnessed much of this before . two years ago , scores of new economy companies soared to irrational values then collapsed in dust as investors came to question their business models and prospects . the dot - com bubble cost investors trillions . it ' s time to get serious about the lessons it taught us . in particular , we need to consider the responsibilities and accountability of all players in the system as we review what happened at enron and the broader issues it raises . millions of individuals now depend in large measure on the integrity and stability of our capital markets for personal wealth and security . of course , investors look to management , directors and accountants . but they also count on investment bankers to structure financial deals in the best interest of the company and its shareholders . they trust analysts who recommend stocks and fund managers who buy on their behalf to do their homework - - and walk away from companies they don ' t understand . they count on bankers and credit agencies to dig deep . for our system to work in today ' s complex economy , these checks and balances must function properly . enron reminds us that the system can and must be improved . we are prepared to do our part . -

the - street rival breached its merger agreement by breaking off the deal this past week . the suits escalate a war of words between the two houston companies over who was responsible for the merger breakup that contributed to enron ' s tumble into bankruptcy - court proceedings and they threaten to be a serious distraction for dynegy , another energy - trading highflier . credit agencies continue to penalize dynegy for gambling on an effort to buy enron , and dynegy ' s stock is off more than those of other companies with significant energy - trading operations . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares fell $ 3 . 18 to $ 27 . 17 each , below their 52 - week low .  still , dynegy is aggressively trying to build up its energy - trading business . dynegy ' s president and chief operating officer , steve bergstrom , who worked for enron in the early 1980 s , is considered one of the brightest lights in energy trading and dynegy has been moving to bulk up its base of pipelines , production and power - plant capacity to complement its trading operations . as enron was cratering last week , dynegy swiftly moved to capitalize on enron ' s sudden inability to provide enough credit security for natural - gas - supply deals . as enron traders scrambled to match buyers and sellers and disgorge its obligations for delivering gas to its customers ,  since oct . 1 , the number of customers executing agreements on dynegydirect , dynegy ' s online trading platform , has increased 20 % and dynegy ' s physical trading business also has increased , mr . bergstrom told analysts yesterday .  many enron traders are said to be upset with management for the implosion of the company .  copyright ? 2000 dow jones now , lifeline is sought for trading unit by wall street journal staff reporters mitchell pacelle , jathon sapsford and ann davis  the wall street journal a 3 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) turning to some of its largest creditors as potential saviors , enron corp . secured as much as $ 1 . 5 billion in new financing from j . p . morgan chase the move comes after enron ' s $ 10 billion suit against dynegy filed sunday for breaching its merger agreement . -

law proceeding ? in the case of enron corp . , about 30 . that ' s the number of attorneys new york law firm weil , gotshal & manges , enron ' s bankruptcy counsel , says it had on the case before it was filed over the weekend in federal bankruptcy court in new york . enron ' s chapter 11 filing , one of the largest in corporate history , is also apt to be one of the most lucrative - - for lawyers representing the company and those counseling its creditors , as well as an expected army of financial advisers and turnaround pros . the slackening economy and the burst of large chapter 11 cases - - five of the 15 biggest chapter 11 s of all time have been filed this year - - have left the formerly insular bankruptcy bar busier than ever and with a new cachet . with demand growing , rates are rising , reaching $ 700 an hour for the top lawyers . that is starting to put bankruptcy lawyers in the same league with merger specialists and trial attorneys . the pending chapter 11 case of pg & e corp . ' s utility unit this spring , some experts predict , could generate legal and other fees topping $ 400 million .  besides weil , enron has retained new york firm skadden , arps , slate , meagher & flom as  enron ' s bank creditors , who hold a chunk of the company ' s $ 13 billion in debt , have lined up two large wall street firms of their own . shearman & sterling is advising longtime client citigroup inc .

' s general electric capital corp . litigation between enron and its erstwhile merger partner , dynegy inc . , is also expected to trigger many billable hours . dynegy , which sued enron yesterday , seeking the right to complete the acquisition of enron ' s crown jewel pipeline system , has retained houston firm baker botts , along with akin gump strauss hauer & feld , based in dallas and washington . enron , which launched its own pre - emptive lawsuit in bankruptcy court on sunday against dynegy , is represented by weil securities litigator greg danilow and corporate chief thomas roberts , who recently handled amr corp .

' s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marks the beginning of complicated jockeying as hundreds of creditors seek to get the most they can at the expense of other creditors . filings expected to be submitted to the court subsequent to enron ' s original petition sunday will at least partially lift the veil of secrecy that has long hovered over the company ' s dealings . but for now , few of enron ' s many unsecured creditors have any idea how much they can hope to recover , thanks to enron ' s complex structure and the huge liabilities that were tucked away in partnerships not consolidated onto the company ' s balance sheet . in its chapter 11 filing , enron corp . listed $ 13 . 15 billion in debt . when combined with obligations of its 13 subsidiaries also in bankruptcy proceedings , on - balance - sheet debt totals $ 31 . 24 billion . some bankers who are involved estimate the parent company has an additional $ 27 billion in off - balance - sheet and contingent liabilities . the combined list of creditors attached to enron ' s bankruptcy filing is 54 pages long . precisely because there are so many claims , the contesting among enron ' s creditors is expected to be especially fierce . while bankruptcy law specifies a clear ranking of claims - - with senior secured creditors at the top of the pyramid , the mass of unsecured claims beneath them and equity holders at the bottom - - bankruptcy proceedings aren ' t always set in stone .  in coming weeks , enron will file other legal documents that will be widely scrutinized by creditors and potential vulture investors , who buy distressed debt , for information about the ultimate value of the company . until now , many distressed - debt players have been on the sidelines , citing the impossibility of understanding enron ' s business operations , the extent of its liabilities and the possibility that its financial records contain misstatements beyond the restatements announced last month by enron .   complicating the negotiations : claimants and creditors are a varied lot with diverse interests , reflecting enron ' s combination of physical and financial assets - - thousands and thousands of financial contracts , whose value is uncertain and likely to be highly contentious . usually , it is the unsecured creditors who compete most intensely for a share of the assets . in order to compete , the savviest creditors , such as the distressed - debt funds , which usually acquire debt positions at discounted prices , engage in a variety of strategies . for instance , they may threaten senior classes with the specter of a long drawn - out legal battle unless concessions are made . or , because each class of creditors gets to vote on any settlement , one party may buy up others ' claims in order to control just over a third of the debt of that class - - enough to influence the entire outcome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . auditor andersen is added to enron 401 ( k ) lawsuit  the wall street journal al 0 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - - a lawsuit on behalf of members of enron corp .

wear label on miami ' s football and baseball stadium . twa took down its shingle from the home of football ' s st . louis rams earlier this year , after being acquired out of bankruptcy by american airlines . and psinet , a new -

namers are frequent takeover targets . arco , for example , was acquired by bp plc last year . pacific telesis , parent of pacific bell , agreed to be acquired by sbc communications the day before it announced a $ 50 million naming - rights deal with the san francisco giants in 1996 . shawmut national corp . paid to put its name on a new indoor arena in boston in 1993 , but the company was acquired by fleetboston financial corp . before a single game was played . the philadelphia arena formerly known as the corestates center morphed into the first union center and will become the wachovia center as soon as next summer . the deteriorating financial health of airlines imperils naming deals at six indoor arenas . the former chief executive of ual corp . , whose united airlines unit named the arena in chicago , raised the prospect of filing for bankruptcy next year . some analysts believe the parent of america west airlines , namer of the arena in phoenix , may have to file sooner , if it doesn ' t get requested government aid . not every naming -

naming deals are drifting lower , because of the weak economy and the disappearance of internet firms , many of which were active bidders . more than a dozen u . s . stadiums and arenas are seeking sponsors , including the superdome in new orleans , home to february ' s super bowl , comiskey park in chicago , and the former trans world dome in st . louis . wayne huizenga , who owns the dolphins and pro player stadium , has been seeking a replacement sponsor for more than a year . some companies say they ' ve learned to shy away .  -

cutting moves kpn is planning in conjunction with the offering . yet even with kpn ' s share price already down 25 % from the evening before the share sale was announced , some investors say it ' s still not low enough . kpn closed at 4 . 94 euros yesterday , down from 6 . 6 euros on nov . 19 . investors also want more information on how kpn intends to grow . one question mark is whether the jump in margins at e - plus , kpn ' s problematic german mobile unit , is sustainable . the offering is  the first official indication of investor interest is expected early tomorrow , about 12 hours after the deadline passes for current shareholders to exercise their rights to acquire more shares . unlike a traditional european share rights offering , however , these rights can ' t be traded . that structure has helped keep hedge funds from selling shares in hopes of buying them at a lower price . the dutch government has already committed itself to buying 34 . 7 % of the new shares , and a syndicate of banks have promised to buy the remaining 65 . 3 % shares at 2 . 75 euros , about half the current share price . some professional money - managers are expected to seek shares this way . but others , including u . s . investors , who can ' t participate in the rights portion , are expected to wait until afterward . they have until thursday evening to order shares but , unlike with the rights issue , can specify at what price they ' re willing to buy . many aren ' t expected to place their orders before thursday .  the share offering nonetheless comes at a time when investors are turning more positive toward the telecom sector in general after shunning it for more than a year . finland ' s sonera corp . , another heavily indebted telecom group , raised one billion euros through a heavily discounted rights issue to existing shareholders last month . the mood has soured somewhat in recent days , hurt by signs that the u . s . economy won ' t recover as quickly as investors had been hoping . the collapse of enron corp . also has refocused investor attention on credit risk . investors note that it ' s particularly difficult to estimate kpn ' s fair value because its heavy debt load means a small change in financial assumptions about the company can create a big change in the valuation .  kpn isn ' t a  but joost eijsink , an asset manager at dutch investment bank eureffect , predicted that while selling pressure will increase throughout the week , most of the fall in the share price has already occurred .  mr . eijsink said funds the firm manages are likely to subscribe to the issue . but its advice to other clients will vary . -

the rule , pretty much , is that there aren ' t many rules . for instance , during a conference last week sponsored by the fasb and the american accounting association , attendees were shown a hypothetical example under which the fair value of a power contract could range from $ 40 million to $ 153 million , depending on which assumptions of future trends were used . and the mark - to - market rules that do exist for energy contracts were crafted in large part on approaches that enron and other traders lobbied for .  over the past three years , members of the fasb ' s emerging issues task force have extensively debated the subject of how to value energy - related contracts . what they have decided is that companies should be left to their own discretion , though the task force recognizes that could create problems . in a june 2000 report , for instance , the group noted that two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energy contracts , resulting in widely different valuations .  the task force ' s chairman , tim lucas , says it simply is too difficult to draft a one - size - fits - all solution :  that is in line with the industry ' s longtime position . in a june 2000 letter to mr . lucas , for instance , mr . causey said  in its financial filings , dynegy explains that when market - price quotes aren ' t available for certain long - term contracts ,  quoted market prices offering independent guidance on many short - term energy contracts have become more readily available in recent years . even then , there aren ' t rules specifying which market quotes companies must use . for instance , should companies mark their contracts based on the  on most contracts for short - term deliveries of natural gas , bid - ask spreads are fairly small , about 1 % or so . but even for some short - term electricity contract prices quoted on enron ' s now - shuttered online trading portal , spreads of 20 % were common . on contracts for short - term delivery of telecommunications bandwidth , enron often posted  for other long - term derivatives , such as electricity contracts stretching 20 years or longer , market quotes don ' t exist . in such cases , companies are allowed to base contract valuations on their own undisclosed estimates , covering everything from future commodity prices to credit risks and discount rates .  for now , however , energy traders aren ' t stepping up their disclosures . dynegy ' s senior vice president and controller , michael mott , for instance , says his company  - - - john r . emshwiller contributed to this article . copyright ?

' ' it has it all , ' ' said robert j . rosenberg , a partner who heads the bankruptcy practice at the law firm of latham the firm confirmed last week that it had received s . e . c . subpoenas in the agency ' s enron investigation . judge gonzalez , a brooklyn native who has been a bankruptcy judge since 1995 , conducted yesterday ' s hearing in businesslike , no - frills style . among the law firms with major roles in the enron case are weil gotshal shearman and davis polk & wardwell , among those representing the other lead bank , j . p . morgan chase . lawyers for these and the other firms taking part in the case will quickly find that there is little straightforward about either enron ' s liabilities or its assets . many of the company ' s transactions , for example , involve forward contracts for the delivery of goods - - gas , electricity or other commodities , mr . rosenberg noted . companies on the other side of not - yet - completed transactions have different rights from other creditors . rather than having to file a claim in bankruptcy court , they can take whatever steps their contracts permit in the event that enron defaults . moreover , while enron ' s bankruptcy filings show assets significantly more valuable than the company ' s liabilities , the company also has extensive off - balance - sheet debts that were not listed . ' ' that ' s a good question , whether at the end of the day there ' s enough to reorganize around , ' ' mr . rosenberg said . another crucial question will be whether enron can convince judge gonzalez that the decision by its houston rival , dynegy , to back out of an agreement to purchase enron precipitated its bankruptcy filing . along with its chapter 11 filing , enron sued dynegy on sunday in the bankruptcy court , seeking $ 10 billion in damages for canceling the merger . lawyers expect enron to point to a delaware judge ' s decision earlier this year requiring tyson foods to complete its merger with the meat packer ibp after tyson , citing what it said were undisclosed problems at ibp , tried to walk away from the deal . but that decision was in delaware ' s chancery court , not bankruptcy court , and lawyers said it was hard to predict the success of any attempt to impose that logic on the specifics of enron ' s deal with dynegy . ' ' these types of lawsuits are not a question of federal bankruptcy law , ' ' said one bankruptcy lawyer who insisted on not being identified . ' ' they ' re a question of contract law , of state corporation law . it depends on what the agreement says . ' ' pho collapse may reshape the battlefield of deregulation by joseph kahn and jeff gerth  the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company washington , dec . 3 - - the bankruptcy of enron has washington debating the way it oversees the $ 200 billion power industry . but there is no consensus on erasing the legacy of deregulation that the company ' s political largess helped forge . congressional leaders and top regulators are moving forward on what had been enron ' s no . 1 objective : a push to reduce local control of electricity transmission lines so that energy merchants like the enron corporation can use them to transport and sell power . but the politics of power are shifting , and some of enron ' s longstanding opponents - - chief among them the southern company of atlanta , which owns many local power monopolies - - see a fresh chance to slow deregulation , or even roll it back . among those who have called for inquiries into enron ' s collapse are representative billy tauzin , a prominent republican from louisiana who is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee ; the senate majority leader , tom daschle , and senator jeff bingaman , a democrat of new mexico who is chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee . all are vowing to get to the bottom of one of the most precipitous business reversals in history . and some members of congress say enron ' s downfall , on the heels of california ' s energy meltdown early this year , proves that washington must demand more disclosure from energy traders , holding them at least to the standards of wall street firms . ' ' enron is the sequela to california , it ' s all part of the one - year story line , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , democrat of massachusetts , who focuses on energy regulatory issues in the house . ' ' we can ' t leave energy products in the regulatory shadows . it hurts both investors and consumers . ' ' other influential officials are in no rush to turn back the clock on deregulation . ' ' we have had a number of false starts , and it would be crazy not to take a look at the lessons we can learn , ' ' said nora brownell , one of president bush ' s appointees this year to the federal energy regulatory commission . ' ' but we should not leap to the conclusion that competitive markets do not work . ' ' the bush administration , along with some democrats - - including mr . bingaman and william massey , a democrat on the energy commission - - continue to favor plans advanced by enron that would pry open regional electricity markets . ' ' we have to look carefully at the causes of consequences of enron ' s collapse , ' ' mr . bingaman said . ' ' but i don ' t see anything in this that would keep us from moving ahead with open transmission access and these types of things . ' ' the durability of such views is a sign of how effective enron was during the last decade in keeping washington at bay as the company pushed to restructure the electricity industry and limit government oversight of new energy markets . enron and its employees were the largest contributors to president bush ' s campaigns over the years , and enron gave more money to politicians in the last election cycle than did any other energy company . since 1993 , its employees and its chairman , kenneth l . lay , have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush . in the 2000 election cycle , more than $ 1 million was donated to federal political campaigns , most of it to republicans . mr . lay also had powerful friends . he recruited wendy l . gramm , the top commodities regulator in the administration of president bush ' s father and the wife of senator phil gramm , republican of texas , to serve on enron ' s board in 1993 . the appointment came just five weeks after ms . gramm helped push through a ruling at the commodity futures trading commission that exempted many energy contracts from regulation . last year , as congress and the clinton administration debated whether to exercise more oversight of the financial instruments used by enron and other companies to trade energy contracts , mr . lay courted linda robertson , a senior treasury official who was the department ' s liaison with congress . ms . robertson twice accepted paid trips to talk with company executives while she was still employed at the treasury , her financial disclosure shows . the measure that became law , the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 , specifically exempted energy trading from the regulatory scrutiny applied to brokers of money , securities and commodities . ms . robertson , who became the head of enron ' s washington office , did not return a phone call seeking comment . last spring , when the bush administration drafted a new national energy policy , mr . lay had a 30 - minute meeting with vice president dick cheney to discuss the report . the policy blueprint endorsed breaking up monopoly control of electricity transmission networks , an enron goal that was spelled out in a memorandum mr . lay discussed during his meeting with mr . cheney . enron also had an unusual opportunity to influence mr . bush ' s choices for the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees the markets in which enron operates . mr . lay met mr . bush ' s personnel adviser , clay johnson , to discuss nominees . when mr . bush picked people to fill two vacant republican slots on the five - member commission , both had the backing of enron as well as other companies . enron did not always get its way in washington . it failed to win regulatory exemptions for some futures products it wanted to trade , for example . and with enron now discredited , its longtime nemeses like the southern company hope to turn the regulatory agenda in a direction that favors their interests . the southern company has long been enron ' s main challenger for influence in washington . the company has nurtured a loose coalition of southeast lawmakers - - the senate minority leader , trent lott of mississippi , most prominent among them - - in support of its view that the states should retain leeway in deciding the pace and scope of energy deregulation . so far this year , its political action committees have outspent all other energy companies , including enron and big oil companies like exxon mobil , in supporting members of congress , according to the u . s . public interest research group . southern strongly opposes efforts to diminish the power of local regulators to supervise electricity pricing , production and transmission . ' ' we have long felt that enron ' s vision of open markets does not work with electricity , ' ' said dwight evans , executive vice president of the southern company . ' ' i think our credibility has been enhanced by recent events . ' ' mr . evans said that the federal energy regulatory commission under mr . bush had tried to ' ' design systems that meet what enron needs . ' ' congress should slow the commission , mr . evans argued , or risk a fresh bout of instability and volatile prices . some states have halted the introduction of open markets for electricity . nevada , oklahoma and new mexico are among those that have put off deregulation , while california and a few other states that once promoted unfettered competition are debating ways to reimpose regulatory control . enron ' s assiduous efforts to keep its energy trading free of government interference could be another casualty of its collapse . as the value of energy contracts soared into the hundreds of billions of dollars - - at one point up to half all electricity and natural gas transactions passed through enron ' s trading operation , by some estimates - - enron scrambled to hold off congress and regulators . but some regulatory experts now say that enron ' s collapse is reminiscent of the failure of long - term capital management . long - term capital was the hedge fund based in greenwich , conn . , that operated without direct federal oversight and , by some accounts , threatened world markets when its elaborate portfolio of derivatives crumbled in late 1998 . with its exemption from scrutiny in hand , enron revealed relatively little about its trading portfolio , leaving analysts guessing how it had made its profits . enron ' s secrecy was one factor that caused investor confidence to plummet in recent weeks , after the company revealed some unorthodox financial arrangements that benefited top executives . ' ' enron was getting very heavily into derivatives , and along with wall street banks , they went to bat to keep us away , ' ' said michael greenberger , who was director of trading and markets at the commodities futures trading commission until early this year . ' ' this should be as scary for regulators and congress as long - term capital was .

2000 dow jones section a a defining issue by paul krugman  the new york times page 21 , column 6 c . 2001 new york times company when a seemingly profitable enterprise suddenly goes bankrupt , there are surely lessons to be learned . when that enterprise is the most admired company in america , lauded by business theorists as the quintessential 21 st - century corporation , one wonders if it is the tip of an iceberg . and how many of us have , without knowing it , booked passage on the titanic ? it will take time , and many legal proceedings , before the full story of enron ' s collapse becomes known . but one thing is already clear : the case shows how adept corporate executives have become at shifting risk away from themselves and onto others , in particular onto their employees . enron ' s leaders have walked away from the debacle chastened but very , very rich . many of enron ' s employees - - no doubt including the loyalists who sent irate letters every time i criticized the company - - have lost their life savings . behind this disaster for ordinary workers lies a little - remarked sea change in america ' s retirement system . twenty years ago most workers were in ' ' defined benefit ' ' plans - - that is , their employers promised them a fixed pension . today most workers have ' ' defined contribution ' ' plans : they invest money for their retirement , and accept the risk that those investments might go bad . retirement contributions are normally subsidized by the employer , and receive special tax treatment ; but all this is to no avail if , as happened at enron , the assets workers have bought lose most of their value . it ' s easy to make the theoretical case for defined - contribution plans . such plans expand an employee ' s choices ; he can choose how much to save , and how to invest his money . and more choice is ordinarily good . but the sad fate of enron ' s employees highlights the difference between theory and practice . as gretchen morgenson of the times pointed out on sunday , workers across the country have been cajoled or coerced into holding a high proportion of their retirement assets in their employers ' own stock . the exploitive nature of this financial incest was emphasized by enron ' s now - notorious ' ' lockdown , ' ' in which - - purely by coincidence , say executives - - new rules forced employees to remain invested in the company ' s stock just as the firm began its death spiral . so much for freedom of choice . and even when employees have real choices , one wonders whether they fully appreciate the risks . the shift away from old - fashioned pensions coincided with an enormous bull market ; surely many workers who have never seen stock prices fall since they became investors underestimate the risk of capital losses . one hopes that corporate collapses will not become commonplace . still , it ' s highly likely that millions of american workers will have near - enron experiences , learning to their dismay that big chunks of their retirement savings have evaporated . they will be left dependent on the one great defined - benefit program that remains : social security . that is , if it ' s still around . the bush administration ' s commission on social security reform issued its latest report last week , just as enron entered its death throes . most of the criticism of that commission ' s work , my own included , has focused on its , yes , enron - like accounting : items seem to migrate onto or off the balance sheet to suit the commission ' s convenience . thus when the social security system takes in more money than it pays out , as it does at present , this has no significance - - the federal budget is unified , you see , so it doesn ' t mean anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus . but in 2016 , when the social security system starts to pay out more than it takes in , there will be a crisis - - social security , you see , must stand on its own . but the commission resorts to bogus accounting only to make the case for its ultimate objective : to convert social security from a defined - benefit system , which guarantees retired americans a certain basic income , to a defined - contribution system , in which the unwise or unlucky can find themselves destitute in their old age . some analysts i know think social security will be converted to a defined - contribution system , not because it is a good idea but because the financial industry - - which has enormous clout in our money - driven political system - - has so much to gain from the conversion . i hope they ' re wrong . but if they are right , the fate of enron ' s poor employees , victimized by a management team they thought was on their side , may truly be the shape of things to come . copyright ?

- - the combination of big losses and white house ties would have long since produced cries for a special prosecutor to see what ( if anything ) enron ' s buddies have done on behalf of the company . the upcoming hearings in the republican - controlled house should be fascinating , and there will doubtless be more hearings in the democratic - controlled senate .   even though enron shareholders have been essentially wiped out , lay isn ' t going to the poorhouse . unlike enron employees whose retirement accounts have been vaporized because they consisted largely of enron stock the company wouldn ' t let them sell , lay has plenty of wealth left . last year alone , he made $ 123 million of profit on stock options , according to enron filings . this year he has made an additional $ 25 million or so . note : on friday , with its stock at around 30 cents , enron changed its policy and allowed employees to sell it . ironically , what brought down enron from its lofty perch on the fortune 500 list ( no . 7 ) is that the markets , whose virtue it preached , lost faith in it after it disclosed funny dealings with a partnership run by its chief financial officer . and now , let ' s proceed to the syllabus of enron 101 : 1 . bubbles didn ' t end when dot - coms bombed enron , a major trader of electricity and natural gas , grossed $ 200 billion a year and had $ 60 billion of assets , but it turned out to be a bubble . its business depended on borrowing lots of money . people lined up to lend as long as enron seemed healthy . when suspicions arose six weeks ago after the company revealed its partnership problems , money trickled away . then it started leaving in a flood . as enron tottered , it lost trading business . its remaining customers began to gouge it - - that ' s how trading works in the real world . don ' t blame the usual suspects : stock analysts . rather , blame arthur andersen , enron ' s outside auditor , which didn ' t blow the whistle until it was too late . ( andersen says it ' s far too early for me to be drawing conclusions . ) 2 . deregulation can be dangerous it ' s clear that the cozy world of utility monopolies needed to be shaken up , given huge losses on nuclear plants and other problems . besides , breakthroughs in turbine technology made it feasible for big users such as manufacturing plants to set up their own generators and drop off the electric grid . letting them go would have raised prices for everyone else . but dereg has caused lots of problems . in 1998 , the midwest had huge spikes in the price of electricity and rolling blackouts : some utilities had sold power outside their service areas , and the traders they were relying on to replace that power didn ' t deliver . upstarts have dropped in and out of retail markets in several states , sticking established players with big costs . and , of course , there ' s california , which got caught with too little energy in the spring ( helping enron and others make big profits ) and now is stuck with too much expensive energy . this has crippled the state ' s finances , driven its biggest utility into bankruptcy and clobbered customers . leaving vital necessities such as electricity and natural gas to the tender mercies of the market is risky . especially when a big player such as enron can vanish overnight . 3 . beware your own hype enron pioneered trading in electricity and natural gas , and it was the primo player in that field . but it came to believe that it was good at everything . it wasn ' t . some of the debacles : losses of $ 2 billion each in the water and telecommunications businesses , and another $ 2 billion lost in a brazilian utility investment . it blew an additional $ 1 billion on an electricity - generating plant in india . hence , i think , the need to obscure rising debt levels and less - than - stellar results by dealing with so - called off - balance - sheet partnerships with  the summary the enron affair reinforces two of the oldest lessons there are . to wit : when someone tells you he ' s changing the world for the better and getting rich at the same time , hold onto your wallet . and when something sounds too good to be true , it probably isn ' t true . michael isikoff contributed to this column . sloan is newsweek ' s wall street editor . his e - mail address is sloan @ panix . com . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones rival dynegy sues for pipeline network peter behr washington post staff writer  the washington post final eol copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved enron corp . ' s record bankruptcy action rattled its houston home base yesterday , as the energy trader prepared to lay off 4 , 000 headquarters employees and began a bitter legal struggle with dynegy inc . , its neighbor and would - be rescuer , over the causes of its monumental collapse . enron told most of its houston workers to go home and await word on whether their jobs were gone . meanwhile , dynegy filed a countersuit against enron demanding ownership of one of its major pipeline networks - - an asset dynegy was promised when it advanced $ 1 . 5 billion to enron as part of its aborted nov . 9 takeover agreement . the legal battle began sunday , when enron filed a $ 10 billion damage suit against dynegy , claiming it was forced into a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding when dynegy pulled back its purchase offer following intense negotiations the weekend after thanksgiving . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , chuck watson , said yesterday in a conference call that enron ' s lawsuit   dynegy ' s shares fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10 percent , to $ 27 . 17 yesterday because of investors ' fears that the bankruptcy process will tie up dynegy ' s claim to the omaha - based northern natural gas co . pipeline , forcing it to write down the $ 1 . 5 billion payment to enron .   on the broader impact of enron ' s bankruptcy , donald e . powell , chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp . , said in an interview that regulators believe so far that losses on loans to the ailing energy company will be painful but not large enough to cause any bank to fail . however , he said that the ripple effect on other enron creditors , who in turn may find it harder to repay bank loans , is more difficult to gauge .  shares of enron ' s major european bank lenders also fell yesterday on overseas markets . the stock price of j . p . morgan chase , one of enron ' s lead bankers , fell 3 percent , or $ 1 . 17 , to $ 36 . 55 . enron told a bankruptcy court judge in manhattan that it has arranged up to $ 1 . 5 billion in financing from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to keep operating as it reorganizes under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , according to the associated press . the charges and countercharges between enron and dynegy are the opening rounds in a what legal experts predict will be a relentless battle between the two houston companies . hundreds of lawyers representing investors and employees are lining up to question enron executives and the former enron officials who quit or were fired in the past four months as the fortunes of the powerful energy trading company disintegrated . ahead of them are securities and exchange commission investigators probing whether enron concealed critical information about its problems from shareholders . investigators from the house energy and commerce committee are headed for houston this week to pursue a congressional inquiry into the largest bankruptcy action in u . s . history . and in the lead position is u . s . bankruptcy judge arthur j . gonzalez in new york , who has sweeping powers under federal law to oversee claims against enron , as the company tries to restore its trading business and settle creditors ' claims . dynegy ' s immediate goal is to have the ownership of the northern gas pipeline decided in state court in texas , where the companies are located , said dynegy attorney b . daryl bristow of baker botts .  staff writer kathleen day contributed to this report . http : / / www . washingtonpost . com copyright ?

- once the energy industry ' s crown jewel and the place to work - - filed bankruptcy in new york ' s southern district court on sunday , claiming it owed $ 31 . 2 billion and had assets of only $ 49 . 8 billion . as lawyers for the company began the first steps in seeking chapter 11 protection in a manhattan court , officials in houston monday morning divided employees into two camps : those who would stay and those who would go . shortly after getting the word , the former employees streamed out of the building with boxes of personal belongings . many hung around for hours . they paced , talked in small groups , and took pictures of each other for the last time . it was a strange scene , former employee diane cook said later in the afternoon .  only months ago , enron had the reputation for being a pot of gold , a place where a secretary could become a millionaire . the high - flying energy trading company seemed to be soaring , and employees were enjoying the ride with hefty salaries , lucrative stock options and pension plans . but their company ' s stock dropped from a high of $ 84 to less than the price of a soda at enron field in a year ' s time . for many of the employees , the spectacular collapse of their company is a financial and personal tragedy . many feel betrayed and angry .  one singled out one of their villains .   estes knows that finding a job will not be easy . the information technology market in houston isn ' t that good , she said , nor is the economy in general . and so many former it professionals from enron will be flooding the local market . some said they plan to move . division heads broke the news to their former staffers , giving them about 30 minutes to pack their bags and leave . they were given handouts with   later in the day , new york bankruptcy judge arthur gonzalez accepted enron ' s request for $ 4 , 500 in severance pay for each terminated employee .  but there is no guarantee the court will give more severence pay for employees , said robert rice , an employment lawyer with rice & associates .  cobra , the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act , entitles enron employees to group rates for health coverage for 18 months . employees do have the right to apply for unemployment benefits . they will be paid through friday . medical insurance will be provided through the end of december . former enron employees are networking . they ' ve created their own web site to help the job search process and stay in touch . about 4 , 000 have already listed their names on the site . many at enron know of colleagues who worked there 30 years and lost $ 1 million or more . that ' s because many employees grew accustomed to a steady diet of lucrative stock options that tied them to the company with velvet handcuffs . they built homes , second homes and bought luxury cars . but now , with their options worthless , many are worried how they ' ll keep up those payments . for one employee in the financial mangement area of enron , losing $ 100 , 000 on his 401 ( k ) was bad enough . it paled in comparison to the $ 400 , 000 he lost with his employee stock ownership plan . many of his shares , which were given to him january 1994 , had a strike price of $ 15 a share . it was a sweet deal when he could resell at $ 84 a share . but he didn ' t need the money and opted to hold it for retirement when the tax hit wouldn ' t be as big . some employees blame enron for a good share of their losses in their retirement plans . the company was changing benefit administrators and froze assets in the plan on oct . 17 , the day after enron officials shocked the market by announcing it was taking a $ 1 . 01 billion third - quarter charge to its earnings to unwind unprofitable investments . steve lacey , an emergency repair dispatcher for enron - owned portland general electric , said he watched helplessly as his enron stock plummeted in value . he had invested all of his 401 ( k ) funds into enron stock . one 68 - year - old had been looking forward to a quiet retirement , buying a few acres , planting some crops and spending time with his granddaughter . but his wife , who had worked at enron for more than 20 years , lost nearly everything . now they ' re looking for new jobs . they never imagined that the big , aggressive company would ever come crashing down on them . they weren ' t sophisticated investors and put almost everthing they had into enron stock .  outside the building monday , police officers on horseback , a horde of media and clusters of laid - off workers gathered .    dec . 4 , 2001 , 12 : 01 am houston chronicle in tit for tat , dynegy says it will sue enron would - be buyer says stock price , business harmed by nelson antosh copyright 2001 houston chronicle in a case of one lawsuit breeding another , dynegy said monday it plans to sue enron for damage to the company , including its quickly eroding stock price . the announcement follows sunday ' s $ 10 billion lawsuit by enron against dynegy for canceling the merger that theoretically would have saved it from bankruptcy . this action , which will likely be filed next year because of bankruptcy court rules , would be the second lawsuit brought by dynegy . on monday it filed in district court in houston attempting to force enron to turn over a prized subsidiary , northern natural gas . dynegy received an option to buy the pipeline when it invested $ 1 . 5 billion in enron , but dynegy officials complain enron doesn ' t want to turn over the keys to the pipeline or give back the money . dynegy ' s stock has slipped every day since it broke off the merger last wednesday . on monday it lost $ 3 . 18 to close at $ 27 . 17 . it has fallen 34 percent since last tuesday .  the pain level is high for dynegy officials , he said , but   in prudential ' s view , dynegy ' s stock would have been better off if it had never approached enron . in addition to the lawsuits , the widely publicized deal led to increased scrutiny by financial markets . ken randolph , executive vice president and general counsel , considers the stock price slump temporary ,  he was unable to unable to tell the analysts how long it would take for the situation to be resolved , although they did say the houston suit over the pipeline was expedited for relatively quick resolution .  the ongoing debate isn ' t good for the city or the industry , he said . likewise analyst curt launer of credit suisse first boston said it was impossible to predict how long the dueling lawsuits would continue . but he noted that the bankruptcy of columbia gas in 1991 took nearly five years to resolve . dynegy ' s second lawsuit claim for damages can ' t be filed anytime soon , according to randolph , because enron ' s bankruptcy filing resulted in an automatic stay . there will be a period of time for companies to submit their claims , he said , which means it will be filed sometime in the next few months . they are not estimating the size of their claim for damages , such as costs and expenses , plus the stock price drop . meanwhile , dynegy is attempting to limit the damage and rebuild confidence among investors . the industry is sound , and the fundamentals of dynegy ' s business remain strong , said dynegy president steve bergstrom . the company is finishing a good year and expects an earnings growth rate of 20 to 25 percent for 2002 . since oct . 1 , the number of customers using its dynegydirect web site doubled , and the number of transactions grew by 20 percent . the company said it will begin marketing chevron / texaco ' s natural gas starting jan . 1 , but didn ' t have details . olson considers it  dynegy officials late sunday talked to all three credit rating agencies to provide the latest information and try to convince them not to lower the company ' s ratings . nonetheless , watson said the negative credit watch by the agencies - - which means they are reviewing the company with the possibility of a downgrade - - is expected to continue . the credit rating firms had anticipated a lawsuit by enron and were not surprised by it , he said . dynegy has been on a negative ratings watch since nov . 9 when the merger was first announced , without much impact on trading , officials said . dec . 4 , 2001 , 12 : 00 am houston chronicle pain of bankruptcy to hurt many others ` we ' re just all shocked ' by ralph bivins copyright 2001 houston chronicle the bankruptcy reorganization of enron corp . , the largest chapter 11 ever , will spread financial pain from the big banks in new york all the way to the local locksmith fixing the doorknobs in enron ' s headquarters . enron ' s huge debts , such as the $ 3 billion owed to citibank , the $ 2 . 4 billion owed to bank of new york and $ 1 . 9 billion owed to chase manhattan bank , flash large numbers that demand attention . but plenty of small houston companies - - firms that can ' t absorb major write - downs without really feeling it - - are getting pinched by enron ' s bankruptcy also . berger iron works is owed $ 675 , 000 by enron - - a huge sum for the 108 - year - old houston company . but berger , which created stainless steel stair railings and other items for enron ' s new 40 - story office tower in downtown , will be able to absorb the financial blow somehow , said bill carbery , chief financial officer of berger . berger , which has 45 employees , will not lay off personnel or cut back operations .  kendall heaton associates , a houston architecture firm that is owed $ 200 , 000 for its work on the new enron tower , has been hit hard by the enron bankruptcy case .  kendall , which has 58 employees , said he is hoping to avoid slashing payroll because of the enron debt , but layoffs are a possibility . baker ' s safe and lock co . , which has one full - time employee on - site at enron ' s headquarters , hopes to keep its locksmith shop open at enron ' s buildings , said randy simpson , the company ' s president . baker ' s , with 22 employees overall , has twice been named  he said baker ' s has other significant clients and there are no plans for layoffs , but the bankruptcy could create ripple effects that hurt other enron vendors .  clark condon associates , a houston landscape architecture firm with 22 employees , is owed $ 8 , 000 by enron . clark condon had a $ 40 , 000 contract to work on the new enron building , which will be complete next year , said sheila condon , the firm ' s president . but the company had already collected most of the payment .  losing $ 8 , 000 is not desirable but would not be a tremendous blow to the company , condon said . graphtec , a houston sign firm with 40 employees , has created scores of new signs for the enron building , but not all of them have been installed , said gus brown , vice president of the firm . brown declined to discuss the details of graphtec ' s financial entanglement with enron , which listed graphtec as a creditor . but brown said it is not a crisis for the firm , which has a lot of other work lined up , including the sign work at the new reliant stadium . the enron fallout could even include the annihilation of some small companies , said bill gilmer , an economist for the federal reserve bank in houston .  most small businesses do not depend on a single client for a majority of revenue . but there will be many companies that will see thinner earnings as enron operates at a leaner level in the future , said economics professor steven craig of the university of houston . companies that handled advertising , accounting services or ink for the copying machines could be weaker without sales from enron , craig said . aztec facility services , a houston - based firm that provides custodial service to enron ' s downtown buildings , is expected to lay off some personnel as enron occupies less office space after the layoff of 4 , 000 employees , said bill widman , chief financial officer of aztec .  aztec has about 100 hourly workers cleaning the enron buildings . but enron is current with its payments to aztec and company officials hope to continue working with enron , widman said .  the hines real estate development firm is continuing with work on the construction of the enron center south building in downtown and should be completed next year , a spokeswoman for the houston developer said . hines is owed $ 385 , 000 by enron for its work on the tower , according to bankruptcy documents . dec . 4 , 2001 , 1 : 07 am houston chronicle woes leave enron field ' s name in question astros could do without naming rights distraction by greg hassell copyright 2001 houston chronicle as recently as two months ago , enron executives were toasting their decision back in 1999 to plunk down $ 100 million for the naming rights for houston ' s gleaming baseball park . buying the name enron field had done wonders for the ambitious company ' s quest of making a name for itself across the nation and around the world . without a doubt , they said , it was worth every penny of the $ 3 . 3 million they agreed to pay the houston astros every season for 30 years . but the past 60 days have been a nightmare for the high - tech energy company . with alarming speed , enron has collapsed and is fighting for its survival . with its future in peril , one of the many uncertainties surrounding enron is the identity of its glitzy namesake perched on the eastern edge of downtown . when baseball fans file into the stadium for the astros ' season opener april 2 , will the enormous blue letters spelling enron field still loom large over the centerfield scoreboard ?  for now , enron is paid up on its financial obligations to the astros . the baseball club declined to say when the next payment is due , or how large . the team also declined to say what action it might take if enron fails to deliver the cash on time . for its part , enron officials are saying little about the stadium deal , which is relatively small fry when you consider that the company is embroiled in the largest chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in history .  enron field is but one of the many new stadiums experiencing an identity crisis . in baltimore , the super bowl champion ravens play football in a stadium named after a bankrupt internet service provider . but as beleagured as the company is , it has not yet missed a payment , and the place is still called psinet stadium . in st . louis , the rams play football in a dome that had been named after twa . but american airlines bought out the carrier , and the twa name has been removed from the stadium . the rams haven ' t found another company willing to pony up millions , so the stadium bears the temporary monicker of dome at america ' s center . as dull as that name is , it ' s probably better than what you ' ll find in miami , where the dolphins and marlins play in something called pro player stadium . the biggest problem with that is there ' s no sportswear company called pro player anymore . it has vanished , although the stadium name remains the same . in past naming - rights deals , the heaviest buyers have been high - tech outfits and airlines . both of those industries are in the tank , and it seems unlikely we ' ll see any big deals coming from those quarters anytime soon .  just how difficult finding a sponsor can be during this recession is underscored by the experience of the texas rangers . the team ' s multimillionaire owner , tom hicks , is hunting for a sponsor to buy the naming rights to what is now called the ballpark at arlington . so far , hicks and the rangers have struck out looking .  so if enron backs away from the stadium that was to bear its name for the next 28 years , the astros will be hard pressed to quickly find a new corporate partner to fill the void .  in addition to the weak economy and the glut of stadiums chasing after deep - pocketed sponsors , the economics of baseball may be a spooky proposition for companies looking to use the national pastime to buy some goodwill . with no labor contract in place between the owners and the players , the specter of another work stoppage looms over the game . if that weren ' t bad enough , baseball ' s own commissioner says the game is bleeding $ 500 million a year , and he is seeking to shut down two franchises before the season starts this spring .  gruen takes a less alarmist view of baseball ' s future but agrees that prospective sponsors  which is not all bad . gruen thinks the very worst thing the astros could do is jump into a deal with another company that faces an uncertain future .  dec . 4 , 2001 , 5 : 45 pm houston chronicle enron employees : tell us your stories copyright 2001 houston chronicle if you are -

- enron corp . took steps monday to ensure funding for its day - to - day operations , but the company faces a difficult struggle in the months ahead as it tries rebuild itself . in new york monday , u . s . bankruptcy court judge arthur gonzalez approved a plan for a group of lenders led by j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup to lend enron $ 250 million now , another $ 250 million by jan . 7 and , if all goes well , another $ 1 billion after that . the goal is to ensure that enron ' s core energy trading business survives as a viable entity , by giving other companies confidence they can still do business with enron and expect to be paid . enron officials estimate its trading business alone is worth $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion , said martin bienenstock , an attorney with weil , gotshal & manges , representing enron in the bankruptcy case . enron currently has about $ 500 million in cash on hand , down from about $ 2 . 5 billion it typically had on hand before its crisis began , bienenstock said . enron may never need to dip into that extra $ 1 . 5 billion in cash , bienenstock said . but just having the funds available eases its financial stress .  lenders who make such financing in a bankruptcy proceeding typically get high priority for repayment and their loans come with high interest rates and high underwriting fees . enron chief executive officer ken lay , who didn ' t attend monday ' s hearing , said in a statement the $ 250 million will be used to help enron fulfill obligations needed to run its business , such as employee payroll and vendor payments for goods and services provided on or after sunday ' s bankruptcy filing . enron also is negotiating with three financial institutions in the hopes of revitalizing its wholesale trading business under a new ownership structure . bienenstock expects those talks to be completed within weeks . gonzalez also signed off on a provision to let enron pay up to $ 4 , 500 in severance pay to workers being laid off . workers could get additional severance payments later as the bankruptcy progresses . a small number of employees may be eligible for up to $ 15 , 000 to cover travel and other expenses incurred but not reimbursed before enron sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . enron also will be allowed to keep making payments on its $ 219 million office tower that ' s still under construction in downtown houston . enron has already paid $ 180 million toward the construction costs and any buyer of the property would need to complete the work to realize any value from the project . jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , was the company ' s top executive at the hearing .  as the bankruptcy progresses , enron and its creditors will examine the various parts of the company and decide whether they would be more valuable being sold off or kept as ongoing operations . enron ' s major creditors will meet on dec . 12 to form a creditors committee , which will negotiate with the company on behalf of those still owed money . enron officials will be back in bankruptcy court for another hearing on dec . 14 . enron ' s chapter 11 filing is the largest bankruptcy case in u . s . corporate history . not surprisingly , gonzalez ' s courtroom was packed monday with more than 125 attorneys and reporters . enron and 13 of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors after a planned merger with dynegy fell apart and cuts in enron ' s credit rating triggered serious problems for the company . enron listed assets of $ 49 . 8 billion and liabilities of $ 31 . 2 billion , though it has other debt obligations not listed on the filings . as enron decided where to file , it probably considered that houston and new york have among the nation ' s most sophisticated bankruptcy judges and lawyers in the country , said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy specialist . choosing new york , she said , let enron avoid local issues hovering around the courthouse . and that includes current or laid - off enron workers . monday ' s hearing was just the first step in a process that could take a year or more . despite enron ' s statements that it plans to emerge from bankruptcy protection with a rebuilt business of some type , the odds do not favor it .  eighty percent to 90 percent of companies will fail in their chapter 11 efforts , said jack williams , a law professor at the georgia state university college of law and scholar - in - residence at the american bankruptcy institute , a nonprofit think tank . those that fail - - even those that go in intending to reorganize - - typically end up liquidating all their assets either in the chapter 11 proceeding or converting to a chapter 7 liquidation case , he said . the biggest potential obstacles to success : a too - small asset base , not enough cash and a poor business plan , he said . as a case unfolds , it ' s not uncommon for the true value of a company ' s assets to turn out below the company ' s numbers , williams said . some companies actually file for chapter 11 , even though they intend to liquidate assets , experts said , as doing so gives them more control over a selloff . under a chapter 7 filing , a court - appointed trustee handles the liquidation . before it filed , enron had put much of its portfolio of international assets up for sale . any deals now need approval from the court , with proceeds going to creditors . the creditors committee has a voice in virtually everything that is considered by the judge , said joel kay , an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at hughes , watters & askanase l . l . p . in houston . that includes an opinion on whatever reorganization plan enron files with the court . once a bankruptcy petition is made , the company cannot pay any debts incurred before the filing without permission from the judge , kay said . enron is expected to immediately start sorting through its leases and contracts , deciding what it needs to run the business and what is not needed . for those the judge agrees to let enron keep , it will be allowed to make payments for future goods and services . companies with contracts enron is allowed to reject will be considered creditors . enron does not need court approval to spend money on what is considered the normal course of business . but if it wants to sell assets , borrow money or do something out of the ordinary , it must ask . for example , if enron reaches a plan to revamp its trading operation , the court will need to approve . several stock analysts expressed doubt that enron will come out of chapter 11 or be able to make its trading operation work again , even if a new trading joint venture is created . andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york said buyers and sellers of energy   he expects shareholders - - generally at the bottom of the creditor pool in a bankruptcy filing - - will most likely get nothing out of the bankruptcy filing . the efforts of shareholders and employees who sued enron will be delayed or halted . such lawsuits are stayed and attorneys will have to seek permission of the bankruptcy court to move ahead . dec . 4 , 2001 houston chronicle q & a on the enron bankruptcy why did enron file for bankruptcy ? enron ' s increasing problems - - particularly the reduction in its bond rating to junk bond status - - triggered billions in claims that it could not afford to pay . filing for bankruptcy protection allows it to avoid paying creditors while it works out a plan to reorganize the company . how will the company fund its day - to - day business going forward ? the two top priorities now are finding a source of financing for its day - to - day operations and getting permission from the bankruptcy court to pay essential expenses - - such as their payroll and the cost of benefits like health insurance . at this point why would anyone lend them another penny ? after filing for bankruptcy companies normally seek what is known as debtor - in - possession financing . lenders that provide such financing go to the front of the line when it comes time to get paid back . this agreement , which normally pays a top interest rate , has to be approved by other creditors . the creditors normally go along because continued operations will mean a bigger payout than a complete liquidation . who will get paid back ? bankruptcy law sets the priorities in a bankruptcy . first in line are those with debts secured by the company ' s property . at the bottom are common shareholders . in the middle are unsecured creditors . however , this is all subject to negotiation by the committees representing the parties in the suit . if common shareholders are the last to get paid , why did the stock rise ? there ' s no good explanation . sometimes at the start of a big case , certain parties will buy shares to win a place on the committee representing shareholders . other buyers are traders who see a short - term profit to be made in the price movement of the stock , which trades in pennies . will enron be able to come back ? that depends on whether management can pare this once huge company down to a profitable core . officials within enron have warned the surviving company may be far different than what you see today . often many operations are sold to raise cash to preserve a few key parts . dec . 4 , 2001 , 11 : 23 pm houston chronicle enron ' s recent troubles aug . 14 jeff skilling , who served as ceo for six months , steps down for personal reasons . ken lay assumes the role of ceo . enron ' s stock closes at $ 42 . 93 , off from a 52 -

' ' courting investors the company will use $ 550 million of the $ 1 . 5 billion credit line to repay $ 550 million owed by its transwestern pipeline unit . once transwestern ' s debt is paid the pipeline operator will likely file for bankruptcy as part of enron ' s case , j . p . morgan chase ' s attorney donald s . bernstein told gonzalez . enron sought bankruptcy protection to rescue and revive its trading business , which accounted for most of its $ 101 . 8 billion in revenue last year , said bienenstock . shares of enron rose 14 cents to 39 cents . the stock traded as high as $ 90 . 75 last year . the company ' s 6 3 / 8 percent bonds due 2003 traded around 24 cents , according to deutsche bank . enron corp . is courting investors to revive its crippled trading business , even as it loses customers who fear the company will be unable to make good on its obligations . the company is in talks with financial institutions to fund the wholesale trading business ` ` under new ownership , ' ' enron ' s chief operating officer greg whalley said in a statement . enron and at least 13 units declared bankruptcy yesterday , listing total assets of $ 49 . 8 billion and debts of $ 31 . 2 billion . the company ' s enron gas liquids inc . unit today filed for bankruptcy and was added to the case . dynegy suit enron also is suing dynegy inc . for $ 10 billion for its rival ' s about - face in withdrawing a $ 23 billion bid to acquire enron . today dynegy retaliated , suing in a texas court to gain control of enron ' s northern natural gas co . pipeline . bienenstock said the company had less than a week since dynegy canceled its takeover to obtain temporary financing . ` ` under the circumstances , this was the only available credit , ' ' he said . enron ' s trading business plummeted after the company in mid - october reported a third - quarter loss of $ 1 . 01 billion , bienenstock said . before that , enron ' s trading book carried a value of $ 12 billion . today , that has fallen to $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion , he said . ` ` we do not today have every ` i ' dotted and every ` t ' crossed , ' ' in crafting the chapter 11 reorganization , bienenstock said . more enron affiliates will file for bankruptcy protection ` ` in the days ahead , ' ' he said , without providing details . arthur andersen enron ' s nosedive - - its shares have lost 99 percent of their value - - has also placed a spotlight on arthur andersen llp , the company ' s auditor . enron said last month it overstated its 1998 income by $ 113 million , part of $ 586 million that the company cut from its profits since 1997 . the securities and exchange commission is investigating . ` ` until we ' ve seen the fallout from this bankruptcy , i don ' t think you ' re going to find a lot of entities that are prepared to trade with ' ' enron , said daniel gordon , head of commodities trading at hagerstown , maryland - based allegheny energy inc . , which owns utilities in five states . ` ` anyone who thinks this will be a quick bankruptcy is deluding themselves . ' ' the company had about 21 , 000 employees at the end of september , two - thirds in the u . s . , about a fifth in the u . k . and the rest in other parts of the world . it fired 1 , 100 workers in the u . k . last week . severance workers streamed out of enron ' s sleek glass office tower in downtown houston today , carrying boxes of personal possessions and saying their goodbyes . police officers on horseback helped direct traffic on nearby streets . employees said they were separated at the office into two groups . one was told to leave and check enron voice - mail for updates on their status . others were told they will be kept and were ordered to stay on the job . ` ` the worst thing was the ones they are going to keep were whisked away into a room like they were having champagne and caviar , and we were getting booted , ' ' said chris ihrig , who traded steel and forest products . ` ` they always preached respect , integrity , communications and excellence , and it never was upheld . ' ' enron won gonzalez ' s permission to pay a minimum of $ 4 , 500 in severance to fired employees , to spend as much as $ 40 million to complete construction of its office tower in houston and up to $ 8 million for internet access and other expenses critical to its trading operation . enron ' s lay said he will try to keep workers who are key to running trading operations , which used to provide 97 percent of enron ' s revenue . - - jeff st . onge and jim polson in new york with andy pratt in enron ' s collapse may have repercussions throughout houston 2001 - 12 - 03 19 : 48 ( new york ) enron ' s collapse may have repercussions throughout houston houston , dec . 3 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s bankruptcy and the firing of 4 , 000 local employees , more than half its workforce in houston , evoked words of sympathy from city officials , although the newly re - elected mayor said there are no specific plans for assistance . the impact to houston should be minimal , mayor lee brown told a press conference on his first working day after narrowly winning an election run - off saturday . ` ` seattle didn ' t disappear after boeing decided it would move , ' ' brown said . ` ` we have 20 other fortune 500 companies . . . . one company ' s problems will not impact the other strong companies we have . ' ' state officials were more forthcoming . texas governor rick perry directed the texas workforce commission to send rapid response teams to houston to begin assistance programs for fired workers , spokesman gene acuna said . enron filed yesterday for bankruptcy protection , the biggest such filing in u . s . history , after business began to collapse in october because it wrote off more than $ 1 billion in failed investments amid a $ 1 . 2 billion loss in shareholder equity . investors continued to lose confidence in the company when it restated more than four years of earnings . enron sought to merge with dynegy inc . , but that agreement fell through last week , forcing the largest energy trader to seek reorganization in bankruptcy court . enron shares , which have fallen 99 percent this year , rose 14 cents to 40 cents . dynegy , which is being sued for $ 10 billion by enron for breaking the merger agreement , fell $ 3 . 18 , or 10 percent , to $ 27 . 17 . tide of loss the tide of employees that emerged from enron ' s glass building monday , when the company told most of its workers to go home and await word on their jobs , may have repercussions throughout houston ' s downtown area , affecting new office projects as well as small businesses , houstonians said . the gateway newsstand , situated between enron and a large parking garage , would lose about 30 percent of its business if the energy trader were to cut all of its jobs , owner noor kamdar said . enron workers on lunch break usually crowd the shop for cigarettes , soft drinks and sandwiches . ` ` it has been slow just the past few days , like a holiday , ' ' kamdar said . ` ` i guess we will have to find a new crowd . ' ' houston ' s downtown has been the focus of an intense revitalization effort in recent years , as residential developers build expensive loft apartments and commercial builders construct four new office complexes . about 150 , 000 people work in downtown houston , said laura van ness , director of business development for economic development group central houston inc . the number of people living downtown grew 4 . 5 percent in 2001 , and is expected to increase 15 percent annually for the next five years , she said . office projects enron is completing a second office tower to match its mirrored headquarters . work on the project continues , with completion expected in mid - january , according to hines , the real estate company that ' s developing the project . enron today received permission from a bankruptcy judge to spend as much as $ 40 million to finish the tower . that will put about a million square feet of office space on the downtown market , said dan bellows , president of commercial broker staubach & co . ' s houston office . ` ` it ' ll definitely create a little more vacancy downtown , ' ' bellow said , who estimated vacancy rates could climb to 10 percent from 5 percent now . still , enron ' s buildings are expected to be in high demand in a market lacking large blocks of space for major new entrants . ` ` there are several large companies in this city who have already expressed interest in one or more of the buildings if they come available , ' ' bellows said . other major downtown office projects under construction are pre - leased to anchor tenants that include energy traders reliant inc . and calpine corp . , bellows said . development postponed work on all the projects continues . trammel crow co . , however , postponed its $ 108 million , 34 - story office development because of uncertainty about the impact enron ' s collapse will have on demand . perhaps the most visible loss to houston will be the prestige associated with the company ' s name , which adorns the downtown ballpark , enron field . the trader is among three of the city ' s most visible employers to hit hard times . layoffs were announced earlier this year at continental airlines inc . , where demand dropped following the attacks in new york and washington , and at compaq computer corp . , which is being bought by hewlett - packard co . ` ` if you ' re the ( chamber of commerce ) , you ' re out scrambling around for a new icon , ' ' said barton smith , an economist at the university of houston and director of the institute for regional forecasting . ` ` enron was the icon for houston for the new energy economy .
